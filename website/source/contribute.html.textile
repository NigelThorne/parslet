h2. Bugs 

Log in to github and open a bug ticket
"here":https://github.com/kschiess/parslet/issues. Please be sure to include
the version of parslet and Ruby; maybe you can even provide some code that
exhibits the bug?

And of course if you provide a properly tested patch, you'll be our hero and 
get a place in the space below for lifetime.
